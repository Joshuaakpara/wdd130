            <h2>Half Day Smooth Water Rafting Trip</h2>
            <img src="./images/canyo.jpg" alt="Trip 1">
            <p>Great for all ages, enjoy a ride through a 2-mile long tunnel to the base of Glen Canyon Dam where you will walk to your river raft with sandstone walls soaring 700 feet above you. Your friendly guide will help you aboard our roomy 32-foot raft. Then sit back and relax as you take in the sights and stories of the Colorado River in Glen Canyon including the rich natural and human history of the region. You’ll make a beach stop, where you can take a short hike to see a petroglyph panel and even take a quick dip in the cool river. Back aboard your river raft, you’ll float through iconic Horseshoe Bend. Look for rainbow trout in the crystal-clear water, dozens of birds nesting on the banks of the river and possibly a herd of big horn sheep along the way. Your raft trip ends at historic Lees Ferry, where you’ll board our buses for the ride back to River Headquarters.</p>
