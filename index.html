            <p>Aba is a city in the southeast of Nigeria and the commercial centre of Abia State. Upon the creation of
                Abia State in 1991, Aba was divided into two local government areas: Aba South and Aba North. Aba South
                is the main city centre of Abia State, located in south-east Nigeria. It is located on the Aba River. Aba
                is made up of many villages such as Aba-Ukwu, Eziukwu-Aba, Obuda-Aba, Umuokpoji-Aba and other villages
                that have been merged for administrative convenience. Aba was established by the Ngwa clan of the Igbo
                people in Nigeria as a market town. Later, a military post was placed there by the British colonial
                administration[2] in 1901. It lies along the west bank of the Aba River and is at the intersection of
                roads leading to Port Harcourt, Owerri, Umuahia, Ikot Ekpene, and Ikot-Abasi.[3] The city became a
                collection point for agricultural products following construction of a British-made railway running
                through it to Port Harcourt. Aba is a major urban settlement and commercial centre in its region, which
                is surrounded by small villages and towns. The indigenous people of Aba are the Ngwa. Aba is well known
                for its craftsmen and also the most populous city in the Southeastern Nigeria. As of 2016, Aba had an
                estimated population of 2,534,265.[1] The state's slogan is "God's Own State".</p>
